#Magnus Woodcraft#

<h4>Magnus Woodcraft is a rustic-modern and unique website that was designed to give the user an obvious idea as to what the business is about. This business aims to produce, unique
aesthetic designs, inspired by centuries-old wood-crafting techniques. I decided to design this website as my partner is setting up a carpentry business and I wanted to help him design his website.
It did not take me long to decide how to utilise this website for more than one purpose, one being for the project and the other - to allow maximum productivity and traffic to his company.</h4>

<h2><u><b>User Experience UX</b></u></h2>
<p>
This website is for the sole trading carpenter of Magnus Woodcraft, a newly developed company based in the North of England.
They want to achieve a simple and aesthetic way of advertising their works, aswell as having a simple yet effective method for receiving orders from customers.
The website achieves these objectives by creating a brand and logo for the company, while using Bootstrap4 forms to allow simple submission of orders for the customer and visual carousels to inspire creativity for custom orders.

<h2><b><u>Design</b></u></h2>
<ol>
<li><p>The main colours used on the website are gold, black and white.</p></li>
<li><p>The fonts used include: </p></li>
<li><p>Imagery: The imagery is very unique, using an oak-wood pattern, naturally seen when planing the trunks of trees. A gradient is used to highlight the logo and brand name.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2><b><u>Features</b></u></h2>
<p>The index.html page is used to give an aire of mystery to the website and increase interest in the web-user. Inspiration was taken from Alice in Wonderland with the woodland background,
used to develop a hint to what Magnus Woodcraft is about.</p>
<p>The home.html page holds the first nagivation and webpage that is seen once the user clicks on the enter button on the previous page.
A simple design is used to create more focus on the business itself, but a unique color palette is used to create consolidation and to make the site stand out visually.</p>
<p>The about.html page is self-explanatory but is very visual rather than giving the user lots of verbal information that is more difficult to remember. The images and carousels are used
to create a simple ideas board that the user can then take with them, before designing their own custom order. </p>
<p>The projects page is designed to attract attention from a more professional and
wider reaching audience. This page also showcases the abilities of the carpentry company, showing potential buyers the levels of expertise that the carpenters possess. 
<p>Finally the order.html and thank.html pages allow the user to submit their details, orders and ideas to the business. Allowing for simple and easy communication to the company. The thank.html page was developed as I was
unable to code for an order form submission technique using PHP.</p>
<p>The website is fully responsive on all device sizes such as desktop, tablet and phone.</p>

<h3><u>Future features</u></h3>
<p>Future features to include into the website would be a blog, shop page and review/comments section.</p>

<h2><u>Further testing</u></h2>
<p>1. Navigation: Each navigational link directs the user to the desired page. For example, clicking on the Home link takes the user to the home page, clicking the about link takes the user to the about page etc.</p>
<p>2. Navigation scrolling bar: Navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page even when scrolling down.</p>
<p>3. Image responses: Images on all pages are fully responsive and are increased/decreased to an appropriate size and resolution across all screen sizes.</p>
<p>4. Content position: All fonts, page sections, carousels, headings, sub-headings, text sections, images and order-form remain in their appropriate positions and do not over-lap eachother, their respective parent divs or misalign, regardless of screen size. This was achieved by clicking "Open Source" after every alteration in the CSS code and running the new code, whilst expending and shrinking the display screen.</p>
<p>5. Order form: The order form on the order.html page submits to the thank.html page only when all text fields have their respective information.</p>

<u>Unfixed Bugs:</u> The social media links do not seem to work on the open server, and the social media pages for this company do not exist yet.
